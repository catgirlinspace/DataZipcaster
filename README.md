Data Zipcaster
==============

Named after the [Zipcaster](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Zipcaster) special from Splatoon 3, Data Zipcaster serves as a versatile data transportation platform focused on enabling seamless data interchange between Splatoon 3 related projects and the official SplatNet 3 service.

Data Zipcaster boasts a robust Command Line Interface (CLI), crafted with Python and supported across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. With the CLI, users can easily access and utilize the extensive features of the platform. Moreover, the CLI is conveniently available as a Python package for integration into other Python projects, aiming for the utmost ease-of-use.

In addition to its fully featured CLI, Data Zipcaster also offers an automatic updater, ensuring that users always have the latest version of the platform. This feature is especially useful for those less familiar with the command line, as it eliminates the need for manual updates that may be difficult to perform for some users.

Data Zipcaster prioritizes user experience with its intuitive error handling system. The platform is designed to provide clear and comprehensible error messages, making it user-friendly even for those less acquainted with tech. In the case of a fatal error that Data Zipcaster cannot recover from, the platform will automatically generate a crash report, which can be submitted to the developers for further investigation.

At its core, Data Zipcaster embodies the Open/Closed Principle, significantly simplifying the creation of new importers and exporters. This powerful tool thus offers a seamless data management experience by handling most of the complexity at its core, allowing newer developers to meaningfully contribute to the platform with ease.
